# This is the source of my personal site

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I want to have my work experience, ideas, some interesting articles, some 
markdown documents and memo saving in this site.
